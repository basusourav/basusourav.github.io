									<p><ul>
										<li><b>Empathy</b><br/>
											You can sense the emotions of those around you. You can feel what they are feeling as though their feelings are your own. 
											Intuitively, you are able to see the world through their eyes and share their perspective. You do not necessarily agree with 
											each person’s perspective. You do not necessarily feel pity for each person’s predicament—this would be sympathy, not Empathy. 
											You do not necessarily condone the choices each person makes, but you do understand. This instinctive ability to understand is powerful. 
											You hear the unvoiced questions. You anticipate the need. Where others grapple for words, you seem to find the right words and the right tone. 
											You help people find the right phrases to express their feelings—to themselves as well as to others. You help them give voice to their emotional life. 
											For all these reasons other people are drawn to you.</li>
										<li><b>Consistency</b><br/>
											Balance is important to you. You are keenly aware of the need to treat people the same, no matter what their station in life, 
											so you do not want to see the scales tipped too far in any one person’s favor. In your view this leads to selfishness and individualism. 
											It leads to a world where some people gain an unfair advantage because of their connections or their background or their greasing of the wheels. 
											This is truly offensive to you. You see yourself as a guardian against it. In direct contrast to this world of special favors, you believe that 
											people function best in a consistent environment where the rules are clear and are applied to everyone equally. This is an environment where people 
											know what is expected. It is predictable and evenhanded. It is fair. Here each person has an even chance to show his or her worth.</li>
										<li><b>Developer</b><br/>
											You see the potential in others. Very often, in fact, potential is all you see. In your view no individual is fully formed. On the contrary, 
											each individual is a work in progress, alive with possibilities. And you are drawn toward people for this very reason. When you interact with 
											others, your goal is to help them experience success. You look for ways to challenge them. You devise interesting experiences that can stretch them 
											and help them grow. And all the while you are on the lookout for the signs of growth—a new behavior learned or modified, a slight improvement in a 
											skill, a glimpse of excellence or of “flow” where previously there were only halting steps. For you these small increments—invisible to some—are clear
											 signs of potential being realized. These signs of growth in others are your fuel. They bring you strength and satisfaction. Over time many will seek you 
											 out for help and encouragement because on some level they know that your helpfulness is both genuine and fulfilling to you.</li>
										<li><b>Responsibility</b><br/>
											Your Responsibility theme forces you to take psychological ownership for anything you commit to, and whether large or small, you feel emotionally bound 
											to follow it through to completion. Your good name depends on it. If for some reason you cannot deliver, you automatically start to look for ways to make 
											it up to the other person. Apologies are not enough. Excuses and rationalizations are totally unacceptable. You will not quite be able to live with yourself 
											until you have made restitution. This conscientiousness, this near obsession for doing things right, and your impeccable ethics, combine to create your 
											reputation: utterly dependable. When assigning new responsibilities, people will look to you first because they know it will get done. When people come 
											to you for help—and they soon will—you must be selective. Your willingness to volunteer may sometimes lead you to take on more than you should.</li>
										<li><b>Includer</b><br/>
											“Stretch the circle wider.” This is the philosophy around which you orient your life. You want to include people and make them feel part of the group. 
											In direct contrast to those who are drawn only to exclusive groups, you actively avoid those groups that exclude others. You want to expand the group 
											so that as many people as possible can benefit from its support. You hate the sight of someone on the outside looking in. You want to draw them in so that 
											they can feel the warmth of the group. You are an instinctively accepting person. Regardless of race or sex or nationality or personality or faith, you cast 
											few judgments. Judgments can hurt a person’s feelings. Why do that if you don’t have to? Your accepting nature does not necessarily rest on a belief that 
											each of us is different and that one should respect these differences. Rather, it rests on your conviction that fundamentally we are all the same. We are 
											all equally important. Thus, no one should be ignored. Each of us should be included. It is the least we all deserve.</li>
